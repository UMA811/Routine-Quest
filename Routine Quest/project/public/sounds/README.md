# Sound Files Directory

The app requires the following sound files (not included in the repository):

1. `click.mp3` - A short click sound for task completion
2. `victory.mp3` - A celebration sound when all tasks are completed
3. `move.mp3` - A movement sound when the character advances on the map

To use sounds in the app, place appropriate MP3 files in this directory with these names.

For testing/development, you can find royalty-free sounds on sites like:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
